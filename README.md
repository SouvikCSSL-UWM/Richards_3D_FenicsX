# 3D Richards Equation Simulation using FEniCSx
## Author: Souvik Roy, Roshan M. D'souza

This repository simulates unsaturated water flow through soil using the **3D Richards Equation** in its moisture content form. The numerical solution is implemented in [FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org/), leveraging **Picard iteration** for stability and convergence. Moisture distribution is visualized dynamically via PyVista and Matplotlib.
